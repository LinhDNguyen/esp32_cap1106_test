# Custom configuration entries, settable via "device configuration"
# Below is a custom firmware configuration example.
# Uncomment and modify according to your needs:

# config_schema:
#  - ["my_app", "o", {title: "My app custom settings"}]
#  - ["my_app.bool_value", "b", false, {title: "Some boolean value"}]
#  - ["my_app.string_value", "s", "", {title: "Some string value"}]
#  - ["my_app.int_value", "i", 123, {title: "Some integer value"}]

# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# printf("Hello from %s!\n", mgos_sys_config_get_device_id());
#
# Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
#
# To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
# build/gen/mgos_config.h file.
#
# Also, in this config_schema section, you can override existing
# settings that has been created by other libraries. For example, debug log
# level is 2 by default. For this firmware we can override it to 3:
#
config_schema:
  - ["debug.level", 3]
  - ["i2c.enable", "b", false, {title: "Enable I2C"}]
  - ["i2c.debug", "b", false, {title: "Debug I2C bus activity"}]
  - ["i2c.freq", 100000]
  - ["i2c.unit_no", "i", 0, {title: "Which hardware unit ot use, 0 or 1"}]
  - ["i2c.sda_gpio", "i", 5, {title: "GPIO to use for SDA"}]
  - ["i2c.scl_gpio", "i", 18, {title: "GPIO to use for SCL"}]
